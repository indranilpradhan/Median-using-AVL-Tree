# Median-using-AVL-Tree

In a sorted array of integers , median of the array is defined as follows
● If there are odd numbers of elements in an array , median element is the middle
of that array E.x [ 1 , 2 , 3] median is 2 and for [ 1 , 3 , 3] median is 3
● If there are even numbers of elements in an array , median element is average of
two middle elements of that array E.x [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] median is ( 2 + 3 ) / 2 and for
[ 1 , 3 , 3 , 5 ] median is 3.
Problem Description : Given a stream of integers , after occurrence of every
number , output the median of array.
Example: Given sequence is 5 , 7 , 1 , 6 , 2 , 3
Explanation: [ 5 ] median is 5 [ 5 , 7] median is (5+7)/2 [ 5 7 1 ] sorted array is
[1 5 7 ] median is 5 [5 7 1 6] sorted array is [1 5 6 7] median is (5 + 6)/2.
Crux of Problem: It has to be solely implemented using AVL Tree otherwise 0
marks will be awarded.
